# ImprovedPerlinDemo
A demonstration of Perlin Noise Generation (3D Perlin represented in 1D and 2D) in regards to pure random noise built in C# in Unity.

The project can be downloaded [here](publish/ImprovedPerlinStandalone.zip) and can be run on windows. Just unzip the project and run NoiseGeneration.exe to use it!

If you would like to run it on another operating system or modify the project code, you are welcome to use the source code as you please.

## Representations

## Controllable Features
 - X, Y, and Z coordinate offsets of perlin noise
 - Scale of perlin noise coordinates
 - Octave count - the amount of layers of perlin added together
 - Persistance - the amount by which each octave contributes to the overall shape (amplitude modifier)
 - Lacunarity - determines the amount of detail added by each octave (frequency modifier)
